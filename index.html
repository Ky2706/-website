        <p>Hello, didn't expect this yea? I didn't expect you to click this link either. Anyways this could be sitting here forever and not be read...
          or not. If you're reading this, hope you're doing fine. There's no particular reason why I updated this, just randomly recalled I made you
          this website and thought about updating it. So now I guess this website is like a one way message that might or might not get through. As of right
          now at the end of 2023, if you're wondering yes I still like you but I'm clear enough to know there's no way we would end up together. We could still
          interact like normal friends but yea that's about it. It's not like I don't wanna let go you know, I just like you way too much. Deep down I wanted to get to know you more and be more than just friends, but I'll let you 
          have your way for the better of us. We're still good friends right?
        </p>

        <p>PS: I kept the code for the graduation one you saw but this one is much better AHAHAHA</p>

        <p>It's actually 3am now HAHA. Randomly thought about writing this at this moment cause why not. Oh ya, few days ago when I was working I got my results
          also, guess what? I got a 3.5 HAHAHA, although compared to my friends it's the lowest I think I at least deserve this much. I'll work harder this semester.
          Anyways I texted you recently, about that music run ticket you were selling. Sorry for the late replies cause I was working, and about the discount I ask 
          from you, thanks alot. I asked for it because maybe then I can pay you back next time by buying you something like a drink. Hopefully if I ever pull this 
          stunt it won't ruin us, if I have the courage to do it anyways. Also I'm starting to feel kind of lonely in university, I don't know why it feels like I can't
          mix in with my friends anymore. But should be fine, cause I kinda forget about everything when I went to work, met a lot of good people there as well.
        </p>

        <p>PS: Wish you could go to music run as well... maybe next year? klcc go together?</p>
