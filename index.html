          <p>Hello, didn't expect this yea? I didn't expect you to click this link either. Anyways this could be sitting here forever and not be read...
            or not. If you're reading this, hope you're doing fine. There's no particular reason why I updated this, just randomly recalled I made you
            this website and thought about updating it. So now I guess this website is like a one way message that might or might not get through. As of right
            now at the end of 2023, if you're wondering yes I still like you but I'm clear enough to know there's no way we would end up together. We could still
            interact like normal friends but yea that's about it. It's not like I don't wanna let go you know, I just like you way too much. Deep down I wanted to get to know you more and be more than just friends, but I'll let you 
            have your way for the better of us. We're still good friends yea?
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>PS: I kept the code for the graduation one you saw but this one is much better AHAHAHA</p>

          <p>It's actually 3am now HAHA. Randomly thought about writing this at this moment cause why not. Oh ya, few days ago when I was working I got my results
            also, guess what? I got a 3.5 HAHAHA, although compared to my friends it's the lowest but I think I at least deserve this much. I'll work harder this semester.
            Anyways I texted you recently, about that music run ticket you were selling. Sorry for the late replies cause I was working, and about the discount I ask 
            from you, thanks alot. I asked for it because maybe then I can pay you back next time by buying you something like a drink. Hopefully if I ever pull this 
            stunt it won't ruin us, if I have the courage to do it anyways. Also I'm starting to feel kind of lonely in university, I don't know why it feels like I can't
            mix in with my friends anymore. But should be fine, cause I kinda forget about everything when I went to work, met a lot of good people there as well.
          </p>

          <p>PS: Wish you could go to music run as well... maybe next year? klcc go together?</p>

          <p>Saw kek post tdy then ah whole day think you again d luu. Looks like yall had a fun time, wish I can hangout with you more just like they can. If you think about it,
            I don't know if I ever mention it before on the two paragraph on top but like if the S1 grp or KLCC just stopped going out one day, I would have no chance to even 
            interact with you. Owh ya, suddenly remember Zoe said you as of right now is like, have no interest in relationships whatsoever. Soooo erm, sounds like I popped out 
            at a very inconvenient time huh. Just got me curious like if you suddenly got into a relationship when would it be HAHAHA. Anyways the next time we meet would probably be 
            at Sandy's house right? Looking forward to that day.
