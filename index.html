        <p>Hello, didn't expect this yea? I didn't expect you to click this link either. Anyways this could be sitting here forever and not be read...
          or not. If you're reading this, hope you're doing fine. There's no particular reason why I updated this, just randomly recalled I made you
          this website and thought about updating it. So now I guess this website is like a one way message that might or might not get through. As of right
          now at the end of 2023, if you're wondering yes I still like you but I'm clear enough to know there's no way we would end up together. We could still
          interact like normal friends but yea that's about it. It's not like I don't wanna let go you know, I just like you way too much. Deep down I wanted to get to know you more and be more than just friends, but I'll let you 
          have your way for the better of us. We're still good friends yea?
        </p>

        <p>PS: I kept the code for the graduation one you saw but this one is much better AHAHAHA</p>
